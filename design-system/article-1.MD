## 1. Visual Language

<b>Visual Consistency</b>

- creating unified style-guide standard for colors, fonts, sizes, positions, etc.

Important two assets:

1. <b>style-guide</b> - defines the styling and implementation of UI
2. set of <b>reusable visual elements</b> - brings together both visual UI and functional (UX) consistency through components (usually drawn on Figma / Sketch etc)

<br />

## 2. Shared Components

Instead of publishing a single one-size-fits package for components, create an ecosystem where everyone works together yet delivers independently

<br />

## 3. Documentation and Discovery

- Local development
- Docs on the cloud
- Discovery and search easily

<br />

## 4. Incremental Upgrades

Versioning independent components is much better than versioning all components as a single package.

- Component developers can control each component's version bumps according to sem-ver rules, view its history and even its view changelog
- App builders dont get updates they dont need

<br />

## 5. Rippling Changes to Dependencies

<br />

## 6. Project Updates

<br />

## 7. Team Communication

<br />

## 8. Designer - Developer Collaboration
